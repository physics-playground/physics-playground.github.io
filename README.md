# Physics Playground

Hello there and welcome to the **Physics Playground**! ðŸ‘‹

![Physics Logo](/github/logo/physics_logo.png)

This is the home to various implementations of real-time physics engines. Each fork is expected to be almost identical to original but with a few changes:

* Added CI support with GitHub actions.
* Build and run scripts in the root of each one to allow anyone to easily build.
* Support for Windows, Linux, and macOS by default for developers.
* Editor configuration files for VSCode, CLion, and PyCharm where appropriate.

## Bullet Physics

You can see an example of the WebAssembly version of Bullet Physics at [Bullet/WebGL Demo](https://physics-playground.github.io/ammo.js/).
